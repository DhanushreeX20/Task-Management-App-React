Objective

Develop an intermediate-level React application that incorporates routing, forms, and tables to manage tasks efficiently.

Project Overview

Suggested Project: Task Management App
vite  project link : https://task-management-app-react-nine.vercel.app/

This app allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks. It demonstrates core React skills including routing, form handling, table management, state management, and search/pagination functionalities.

Features
1. Routing with React Router DOM

Home Page: Displays a list of all tasks.

Create Task Page: Form to add a new task.

Edit Task Page: Update task details.

Delete Task: Remove tasks from the list.

2. Form Handling

Task creation and editing forms with validation (required fields, character limits, etc.).

Custom hooks used to manage form state and input validation.

3. Data Management

Tasks are maintained in local state.

Optionally, tasks can be persisted using Local Storage to retain data across browser reloads.

4. Table Component

Tasks are displayed in a tabular format.

Supports sorting by task attributes (e.g., title, priority, date).

Filtering tasks based on criteria like status or category.

5. Pagination and Search

Pagination: Breaks down the task list into manageable pages.

Search Functionality: Quickly find tasks by keyword matching in title or description.

Technologies Used

React.js

React Router DOM for routing

Custom Hooks for form management

CSS / Tailwind / Styled-Components (depending on preference)

Local State & Local Storage for task data

React Table or custom table component for sorting/filtering

Usage

Navigate to Home to view tasks.

Click Add Task to create a new task.

Edit or delete tasks directly from the table.

Use the search bar to find specific tasks.

Navigate through pages if there are many tasks.

Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will be able to:

Implement React Router for multi-page navigation.

Handle forms with custom hooks and validation.

Manage data in React state and local storage.

Display dynamic data in tables with sorting, filtering, and pagination.

Build a functional and interactive React application.
